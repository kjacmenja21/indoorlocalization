# Indoor Localization

**Indoor Localization** is a comprehensive solution designed to track and manage assets within indoor environments. This repository includes the full stack for building indoor localization systems, including backend services, mobile and web applications, and visual data insights like floor maps and asset tracking.

## Features

- **Asset Management**: Provides a backend and front-end system for managing assets, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete assets.
- **Indoor Navigation**: Displays indoor floor maps and visualizes assets and their locations in real time.
- **Real-Time Data**: Supports real-time updates and reporting on asset movements and status.
- **Heatmaps and Reporting Tools**: Visual tools like heatmaps for asset visualization and reports for data analysis.

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), API communication with frontend
- **Frontend**: React (for web) and Flutter (for mobile)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing asset and location data)
- **Data Visualization**: Libraries for rendering heatmaps and floor maps
